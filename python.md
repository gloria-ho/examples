# Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable by using English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

- Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it, similar to PERL and PHP.

- Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

- Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

- Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.


## Installing

Installing Python is generally easy, as many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers now come with Python already installed. If you do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task you can find a few notes on the [BeginnersGuide/Download](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) wiki page.


## Learning

Before getting started, you may want to find out which [IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) and [text editors](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) are tailored to make Python editing easy, browse the list of introductory books, or look at code samples that you might find helpful.

There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the BeginnersGuide/Tutorials page. There is also a list of resources in other languages which might be useful if English is not your first language.

The online documentation is your first port of call for definitive information. There is a fairly brief tutorial that gives you basic information about the language and gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the library reference for a full description of Python's many libraries and the language reference for a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax. If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns, you can browse the ActiveState Python Cookbook.


## Setup

Open a terminal window and type "python" to find out if it is already installed and which version is installed.

The most up-to-date and current source code, binaries, documentation, news, etc., is available on the official website of [Python](https://python.org). You can download documentation from [here](https://www.python,org/doc).



## Getting Started

`print "Hello, Python!"`
